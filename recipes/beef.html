    <p>Combine meat and veg in these crowd-pleasing beef rissoles,
        they make a filling and family-friendly supper when served with mash and peas</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, grated</li>
        <li>50g panko breadcrumbs</li> 
        <li>400g beef mince</li> 
        <li>1 courgette, trimmed and grated</li> 
        <li>1 carrot, grated</li> 
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li> 
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed or finely grated</li> 
        <li>2 tsp dried mixed herbs</li> 
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li> 
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li> 
        <li>peas and mash, to serve (optional)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients, except the oil, 
            together into a large bowl with 2 tsp each salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Use your hands to make sure everything is well combined. </li>
        <li>Shape the mince mixture into 14-16 balls, then flatten into 
            small burger-like patties and chill for 15 mins, if you have 
            time (this helps the patties hold their shape).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat and, 
            once hot, fry the rissoles for 3-4 mins, then flip and 
            fry for 3-4 mins more until cooked through. (You may need 
            to do this in batches.) </li>    
        <li>When ready, they should ready 65C on a 
            meat thermometer. Serve with peas and mash, if you like.</li>
